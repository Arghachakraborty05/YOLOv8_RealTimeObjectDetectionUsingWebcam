# YOLOv8_RealTimeObjectDetectionUsingWebcam

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv8s (COCO-pretrained) model through a webcam feed.  
It can detect more than 80 common objects such as Person, Laptop, Mobile, Bottle, Book, Chair, Dog, Cat, and many more.

# 2️⃣ Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3️⃣ Run the project
python main.py


# How It Works

The script opens your webcam automatically.

Each frame is passed to the YOLOv8s model.

Detected objects are shown with bounding boxes, labels, and accuracy.

Since the model is trained on the COCO dataset, it can recognize 80+ object classes instantly.
